# Domain-Driven Design Models

This directory contains models that represent the core concepts of [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). Each model focuses on encapsulating business rules, entities, value objects, and aggregates that reflect the complex problem domain our system addresses.

The purpose is to provide a clear, maintainable structure to represent the business logic, supporting scalable and robust software development. As you explore the models in this directory, you'll see how our design separates concerns and aligns closely with our domain's requirements.

Feel free to contribute by improving existing models or adding new ones in line with DDD principles.
